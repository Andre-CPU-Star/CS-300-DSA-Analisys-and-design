What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that we were solving for the project is taking a list of courses and prerequisites and sorting them based on alphanumeric order. Some of the courses had prerequisites that were needed so when the program ran it needed to print out the main course information and if there were prerequisites. Another part of the program was to be able to load a txt document into the program so the program knew where to sort the information from. Once it was loaded the system needed to sort it using the sorting system, we chose for project one. The sorting system I chose for this project was a hash Table which I picked due to its pros over the other sorting types. The program was run by having a menu that gave the user input options that they would choose and then give them error messages if they inputted the wrong input. The system was able to solve the problem and read the input file, sort it, and output the correct information when the user made inputs.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The way I approached this issue was by using the information in our past hash table assignments, this helped me by giving me the general code for a working hash table, I then made edits to suit the projects requirements. This shows why data structures are important to understand because in the computer world there will be tons of different applications where sorting will be needed and knowing the pros and cons of different sorting types will significantly help in producing the best software applications.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Using the past hash table assignment gave me a  great starting code, which prevented a lot of different roadblocks, once the code was complete there were some road blocks and I overcame those by sometimes just making changes and seeing if it fixed it, and when that didn’t work I would google what I was confused on and read through some google responses which helped me to understand where my road blocks were and how to correct them.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on my project has changed my approach dramatically it has given me more tools to use when the time comes in future programing. The resources for being able to sort different lists and inputs gives me the ability to sort any type of information and output it according to the person’s interests. In today’s world when thinking about everything online that is sorted, I can tell this knowledge with be extremely useful.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on my project has influenced the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable in many ways. When writing this program, it needed to be maintainable which can come through writing it in a way where people can understand and write appropriate notes to help guide people as well. The readability portion of it comes with keeping it simple as possible and again making it easy to read and having good notes that help explain to other people what they are looking at. Lastly, adaptability is important so that the program can be used to sort many types of data types and sizes, so code doesn’t have to be rewritten, maybe just edited a little bit.
